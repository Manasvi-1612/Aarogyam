            <h1>YOGA</h1>
            <p id="firstP">Yoga is a powerful tool for improving mental health and wellness. It has been practiced for
                thousands
                of
                years and has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. At Fantastic Four Mental Health,
                we
                believe that incorporating yoga into your daily routine can be an effective way to improve your
                mental
                health.
            </p>

            <p id="sub-head">
                Here are some of the benefits of practicing yoga:
            </p>

            <p id="secP">
                Reduces stress and anxiety: Yoga has been shown to lower cortisol levels, which is the hormone that
                is
                released in response to stress.

                Improves mood: Yoga can help increase levels of the neurotransmitter GABA, which has been linked to
                improved mood and decreased anxiety.

                Increases mindfulness: Yoga encourages you to focus on your breath and your body, which can help you
                become more present and mindful.

                Boosts self-esteem: Practicing yoga can help you develop a sense of self-awareness and
                self-acceptance,
                which can improve your self-esteem.

                If you're new to yoga, don't worry! There are many resources available to help you get started. You
                can
                find online videos, attend virtual classes, or even hire a private instructor. Whatever your skill
                level, we encourage you to give yoga a try and see how it can improve your mental health and overall
                well-being.
